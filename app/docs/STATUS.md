# LidBoot — current status

**v0.2.0 · 2026-07-15.** Read this before `HANDOFF.md` (that's the historical first audit; everything in it is done).

## What works, and what's actually been proven

Verified on hardware (MacBookPro18,1, M1 Pro, macOS 26.5.2), not assumed:

- The privileged write works from a Developer ID-signed, hardened-runtime, non-sandboxed app on macOS 26 (`euid 0`; wrote and deleted `BootPreference`).
- Reads need no privileges — set `BootPreference` externally, launched the app, it showed the true state with no prompt.
- Refresh-on-activate picks up changes made underneath a running app (`sudo nvram` in Terminal → reactivate → UI updates).
- `Restore Default` round-trips back to the factory state (user-confirmed on the real machine).
- pt-PT renders correctly (checked by forcing the app's language).
- 35 tests green via both `swift test` and `xcodebuild test`.
- The DMG builds, signs, and passes the runtime/sandbox gates; EdDSA signing produces a valid appcast signature.

**Never run: the physical test.** Shut down → close lid → open → must not start up. Then press a key → must start up. This cannot be automated and is the one thing that proves the product's whole premise. Ask a tester to do this first.

## Done since

- **Notarized.** `dist/LidBoot-0.2.0.dmg` — Apple returned `Accepted`, ticket stapled, and `spctl` now says `accepted — source=Notarized Developer ID` (it said *rejected* before). Used the existing `observio-notary` keychain profile: a notarytool profile is credentials for an Apple ID + team, not for an app, and every Hexadexa app ships under team `632VXL3W66`. `notarize.sh` now tries `hexadexa-notary`, `lidboot-notary`, `observio-notary` in order.
- **Installed and launched from the DMG** the way a tester would; Gatekeeper accepts it.

## Shipped — 0.2.0 is live

- **Public releases repo:** `h3x4d3x4/LidBoot-Releases` (created with the user's explicit consent). Holds only the appcast and DMGs; no source.
- **Release:** https://github.com/h3x4d3x4/LidBoot-Releases/releases/tag/v0.2.0
- **Feed (baked into the app):** `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h3x4d3x4/LidBoot-Releases/main/appcast.xml`
- Verified end to end, not assumed: downloaded the DMG from the public URL with no auth, the feed's `length` matches the real file, the EdDSA signature **verifies** against it, a **tampered copy fails** verification, and Gatekeeper on the quarantined download reports `accepted — source=Notarized Developer ID`.

**Feed URL decision:** points straight at raw.githubusercontent.com rather than through `lidboot.hexadexa.io`. The user chose this deliberately — one less moving part. The cost: **the feed URL is baked into every build**, so `LidBoot-Releases` is now effectively a permanent name. Renaming or deleting it breaks updates for every shipped copy, with no remote fix — the only recourse is handing users a new DMG. A redirect in front is what would buy the ability to move hosts later; that is its only purpose.

## Open — needs a human

1. **The physical test.** Still never run. See above.
2. **Sparkle signing key.** Lid Boot reuses the existing key (`g1lZN7…`, the same one Observio uses) — Sparkle's default of one key per developer. Fine, but a compromise would affect every app signed with it.
3. **The app inside the DMG isn't stapled** — only the DMG is. Gatekeeper accepts it via an online check, so this only bites a tester whose *first* launch is offline. Fixing it properly means notarizing and stapling the `.app` before packaging, then notarizing the DMG. Worth doing before a wider beta.
4. **The update path itself is untested.** The feed is verified and parses, but nobody has watched Sparkle actually *find* an update — that needs a 0.2.1 to exist. Test it on the next release rather than assuming.

## Decisions worth not re-litigating

- **One-shot auth, no privileged helper.** Proven to work; a persistent root daemon is unjustified attack surface for a setting changed about twice.
- **Sandbox off → Developer ID only, never Mac App Store.** The sandbox blocks both the IO registry read and the `nvram` write.
- **Only `BootPreference`, never `auto-boot`** (bricks Apple silicon boot). Commands come from a closed enum; a test asserts nothing else is reachable.
- **Refuse rather than guess.** Any NVRAM value that isn't a documented single byte → `unrecognized`/`unreadable`, controls disabled. Deleting stays available because it's safe whatever the variable holds.
- **Hardware gate asks for a lid, not a model name.** See below — this was a real bug.
- **"Start up", never "wake".** `BootPreference` governs powering on from a full shutdown; waking a sleeping Mac is unaffected. Getting this wrong invites bug reports that aren't bugs.

## The bug the first audit missed

The laptop check was `hw.model.hasPrefix("MacBook")`. Apple stopped using those identifiers in 2022 — an M2 Air is `Mac14,2`, an M4 is `Mac16,x` — so **every MacBook newer than M1 was rejected** with "This Mac is a Mac16,1" and dead controls. Since the app requires macOS 15+, that was most of the audience.

It survived a code review and a full test suite because the dev machine is an M1 (`MacBookPro18,1`, passes) **and the test fixture hardcoded that same string**. The lesson generalises: a fixture copied from the dev machine tests the dev machine. It now probes `IOPMrootDomain`'s `AppleClamshellState` (present only on machines with a lid), with a regression test.

## Known gaps (deliberate, not forgotten)

- **No "Report a Problem" / Copy Diagnostics.** There's good `os_log` instrumentation (subsystem `com.lidboot.LidBoot`, categories `nvram`/`service`/`updates`/`login`) that no user can reach. A button dumping app version, macOS version, raw `BootPreference` bytes and the last error would turn "it didn't work" into an actionable report. Worth doing before a wider beta.
- **The menu bar icon is two-state** (`laptopcomputer` / `.slash`, plus a warning badge for refusal/unsupported). It can't distinguish lid-off from power-off from both-off. The tooltip and accessibility label carry the full summary, which is the mitigation.
- **The popover gives no success feedback**, because the auth prompt takes focus and dismisses it — the toggle, caption and summary are all painted on a view that no longer exists by the time the write lands. The menu bar tooltip is the fallback. A notification on success would fix it properly.
- **`unsupported`/`refusal` states have never been seen on real hardware** — they're only reachable via injected fakes in tests. They're designed and unit-tested, not visually verified.
- **No `Cmd-,` in menu-bar-only mode**: the app is an accessory, so there's no app menu. Settings is reachable from the popover instead — this is why that link exists.

## Layout

```
App/                  SwiftUI. All user-facing strings live here (Localization.swift).
  LidBootApp.swift      scenes, activation policy, menu bar item, commands
  LidBootModel.swift    the state machine: read, apply, verify, refuse
  SettingsView.swift    General / Updates / About
  Updater.swift         Sparkle
Sources/LidBootCore/  NVRAM logic. No UI, no user-facing strings, one privileged
                      path behind a protocol.
Tests/                35 tests. Mapping, decoding, service, error mapping, gate.

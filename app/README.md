# LidBoot

A menu bar app and window that stops your MacBook starting up on its own when you
open the lid or plug in power.

macOS has no toggle for this. Apple documents an `nvram` command instead — LidBoot
is a front end for that command, so you don't have to touch the Terminal.

## What it actually does

macOS stores this behaviour in a single NVRAM variable, `BootPreference`, which has
four states. LidBoot shows them as two independent switches:

| Opening the lid | Connecting power | `BootPreference` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| starts up | starts up | *variable removed* (factory default) |
| **won't** start up | starts up | `%01` |
| starts up | **won't** start up | `%02` |
| **won't** start up | **won't** start up | `%00` |

Turning both switches back on **deletes** the variable, leaving NVRAM exactly as it
shipped rather than writing a "default" value over it.

## Important limitations

Two, and both matter:

**This only applies when your Mac is shut down.** `BootPreference` governs
*starting up*, not *waking*. Open the lid on a sleeping Mac and it wakes as
normal — none of this changes that.

**Even then, pressing a key or touching the trackpad still starts it up.**
`BootPreference` only suppresses start-up from *opening the lid* and *connecting
power*. That's firmware behaviour and no app can change it. If you were hoping to
wipe the keyboard without the Mac coming on, this won't do that.

The app says both of these on screen rather than letting you find out.

## Requirements

- **Apple silicon** Mac laptop (M1 or later)
- **macOS 15 (Sequoia)** or later — `BootPreference` doesn't exist before this

Intel Macs are deliberately unsupported: they use a different variable (`AutoBoot`)
with different semantics, and guessing wrong there risks an unbootable machine.
LidBoot detects unsupported hardware and disables itself with an explanation.

## How it gets permission

Reading the current setting needs no privileges at all, so the switches always show
the truth without prompting.

Changing it needs root. LidBoot asks macOS for a one-shot authorisation
(`do shell script … with administrator privileges`), which shows the standard Touch
ID / password prompt. **Nothing is installed** — no background helper, no root
daemon, no login item. You'll see the prompt on each change, which is a fair trade
for a setting you'll touch about twice.

## Safety

NVRAM mistakes on Apple silicon can require DFU recovery, so LidBoot is deliberately
narrow:

- It only ever touches `BootPreference`. It never writes `auto-boot`, which is
  widely reported to leave Apple silicon Macs unbootable.
- The commands come from a closed enum — nothing is ever built from user input.
  This is enforced by a unit test.
- Every write is verified by reading the value back; a mismatch is reported rather
  than assumed successful.
- App Sandbox is off (required for NVRAM access), so LidBoot is distributed with
  Developer ID + notarization rather than via the Mac App Store.

## Build

`project.yml` is the source of truth — the `.xcodeproj` is generated and not
committed.

```sh
xcodegen generate
open LidBoot.xcodeproj
```

Or from the command line:

```sh
xcodegen generate
xcodebuild -project LidBoot.xcodeproj -scheme LidBoot -configuration Release build
```

Run the logic tests (no root, no prompts, under a second):

```sh
swift test
```

`xcodebuild test` runs the same tests through the app's scheme.

## Release

```sh
./scripts/build-dmg.sh                              # archive, sign, package -> dist/LidBoot-<version>.dmg
./scripts/notarize.sh dist/LidBoot-<version>.dmg    # notarize + staple
./scripts/publish-release.sh <version> <build>      # EdDSA-sign, publish, update the appcast
```

`publish-release.sh --dry-run` signs and prints the appcast without publishing.

`build-dmg.sh` refuses to package a build with the hardened runtime missing or
the sandbox enabled, since the first breaks notarization and the second breaks
the app.

Notarization needs a one-time keychain profile (interactive — it wants an
app-specific password from appleid.apple.com):

```sh
xcrun notarytool store-credentials "lidboot-notary" \
    --apple-id "you@example.com" --team-id "632VXL3W66" --password "<app-specific-password>"
```

Notarization isn't optional in practice: macOS 15 removed the Control-click
Gatekeeper bypass, so an un-notarized build makes users dig through System
Settings to launch it at all.

## Updates

Sparkle, on the same model as Observio: built, signed and notarized locally, then
the DMG and `appcast.xml` are published to a **public** releases repo. The app
needs no token, because integrity comes from the EdDSA signature (`SUPublicEDKey`
in Info.plist) rather than from the feed being private.

The feed URL baked into the app is `https://lidboot.hexadexa.io/appcast.xml`, a
Cloudflare redirect to the raw public feed — deliberately, so the backing store
can move without shipping a new build.

See `docs/STATUS.md` for what still needs setting up.

## Layout

```
App/                  SwiftUI: popover, window, app mode, all user-facing strings
Sources/LidBootCore/  the NVRAM logic, independently testable
Tests/                mapping, decoding, service, error mapping, hardware gate
scripts/              release: archive -> sign -> DMG -> notarize
```

`LidBootCore` has no UI, no user-facing strings, and one privileged path behind a
protocol, so the interesting logic is tested with fakes and never prompts for a
password. Wording lives in `App/Localization.swift`; `App/Localizable.xcstrings`
carries en + pt-PT.
